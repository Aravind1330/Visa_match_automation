Hello xxx,

Upon analysis, we utilized the maximum date of transaction creation and invoice creation. We then subtracted the match run date from this maximum date. Below is the table reflecting this data, illustrating that most transactions match within 6-7 days. However, there are instances where the duration exceeds 7 days, which we need to investigate further. Considering the majority within the 6-7 day range, could we potentially aim to reduce this timeframe to 2-3 days?

Best regards,
