Subject: Issue Found in Rule ID 3012 - Ticket Number Matching

Hi XXX,

I hope this email finds you well.

We have identified an issue with Rule ID 3012 regarding the description, which states it should match a 13-digit ticket number. However, the rule string length is not specified, leading to matches occurring with ticket numbers of varying lengths (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 digits).

Could you please review this discrepancy? I've included the details of the rule in the table below for your reference:

Rule ID	Description	Rule String Length
3012	13-digit ticket number match	(Not defined)
Your attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

[Your Name]



In the table below, I have outlined the details of the rule where for a 10-digit ticket number match, string values are specified in the ticket number column to ensure it matches only 10-digit ticket numbers. However, for 13-digit ticket numbers, string values are not specified, resulting in unexpected matches.

Here's an example use case illustrating the issue we encountered:

Ticket Number Type	Ticket Number
T5	7867684
Inv	7867684
In this scenario, although the ticket number is only 7 digits long, it was erroneously matched by the 13-digit rule.
