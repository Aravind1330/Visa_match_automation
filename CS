Subject: Issue Found in Rule ID 3012 - Ticket Number Matching

Hi XXX,

I hope this email finds you well.

We have identified an issue with Rule ID 3012 regarding the description, which states it should match a 13-digit ticket number. However, the rule string length is not specified, leading to matches occurring with ticket numbers of varying lengths (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 digits).

Could you please review this discrepancy? I've included the details of the rule in the table below for your reference:

Rule ID	Description	Rule String Length
3012	13-digit ticket number match	(Not defined)
Your attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
