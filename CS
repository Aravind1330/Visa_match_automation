Upon reviewing the data from March to April for EU ruleid 30, we've noticed a consistent pattern where matches are occurring seven days after the posting date and five days after the transaction date. I've attached a statistical breakdown to illustrate this trend.

Given this observation, I believe there's an opportunity to optimize our processes by reducing the matching time frame to 2-3 days. This adjustment won't affect any global rules and would meet the expectations of premium clients such as World Bank, who prioritize early matches.

Below, I've outlined the rules associated with ruleid 30, highlighting the presence of date filters across all rules:

Implementing this minor adjustment could enhance efficiency and better serve our clients. Your thoughts on this potential optimization would be valuable.

Looking forward to your feedback on this matter.
