Opportunity - CTA refers to companies that have subscribed to the CTA program, granting them access to enhanced data that adds value to their operations. On the other hand, non-CTA companies have not yet subscribed to the CTA program. Our opportunity lies in converting these non-CTA companies into CTA companies, enabling them to leverage the benefits of enhanced data and value-added opportunities. 

 

Benefits- By utilizing the valuable data insights, we can effectively convince potential companies to convert to the CTA program. This presents Visa with great opportunities for revenue generation and increased subscriptions.
