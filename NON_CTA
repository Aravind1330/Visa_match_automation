Non - CTA Insights 

Potential clients from NON - CTA to CTA 

Opportunity - CTA refers to companies that have subscribed to the CTA program, granting them access to enhanced data that adds value to their operations. On the other hand, non-CTA companies have not yet subscribed to the CTA program. Our opportunity lies in converting these non-CTA companies into CTA companies, enabling them to leverage the benefits of enhanced data and value-added opportunities. 

 

Benefits- By utilizing the valuable data insights, we can effectively convince potential companies to convert to the CTA program. This presents Visa with great opportunities for revenue generation and increased subscriptions. Moreover, non-CTA companies can also benefit from these insights, enhancing the value of their own operations. Overall, this strategic initiative allows companies to make the most of the program's offerings and unlock their maximum potential.
