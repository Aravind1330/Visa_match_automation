The code provided is written in Python and it aims to match rows between two tables (T5_table and Invoice_table) and apply a set of rules to identify matches. The matched rows are then labeled with a "Match Rule" index and the rule description is added to a new "description" column in T5_table. Finally, the aggregated data is written to a second sheet in an Excel file.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

    Import pandas library and read the rules from a text file:

python

import pandas as pd

with open("Z:/Desktop/Rules_1.txt", 'r') as f:
    rule_strings = f.readlines()

rules = []
for rule_string in rule_strings:
    rule_string = rule_string.strip()
    if rule_string:
        rule = eval(f"lambda row, row2: {rule_string}")
        rules.append(rule)

The code starts by importing the pandas library and reading the rules from a text file. The rules are stored as lambda functions in a list called rules.

    Define a function to apply the rules to each row pair and return the rule index:

python

def match_row(T5, Invoice):
    for i, rule in enumerate(rules):
        if rule(T5, Invoice):
            return True, i+1
    return False, "Unmatched"

This function takes in two rows from the T5_table and Invoice_table, applies each rule to the row pairs, and returns the matched rule index.

    Read in the T5_table and Invoice_table from Excel files:

python

T5_table = pd.read_excel('Z:/Downloads/Unmatched_trans_Data_1.xlsx', dtype=str)
Invoice_table = pd.read_excel('Z:/Downloads/Unmatched_Inv_Data_1.xlsx', dtype=str)

This code reads in the T5_table and Invoice_table from two different Excel files.

    Create an empty column for the match rule index and loop through each row in T5_table and find a match in Invoice_table:

css

T5_table['Match Rule'] = pd.Series(["Unmatched"]*len(T5_table))

for i, T5 in T5_table.iterrows():
    matched = False
    for j, Invoice in Invoice_table.iterrows():
        matched, rule_index = match_row(T5, Invoice)
        if matched:
            T5_table.at[i, 'Match Rule'] = rule_index
            break
    if not matched:
        rule_description = "Ticket_no_right_of_13, Acct_no, Amount, Currency, Date, C&D indicator, RPIC are same﻿﻿﻿"

This code creates an empty "Match Rule" column in T5_table and loops through each row in T5_table to find a match in Invoice_table using the match_row function. If a match is found, the matched row is labeled with the matched rule index. If no match is found, a default rule description is assigned.

    Create a "description" column based on the "Match Rule" column:

scss

rule_description = "Ticket_no_right_of_12,"
T5_table['description'] = T5_table['Match Rule'].map(rule_description)

This code creates a new column called "description" in T5_table and assigns a rule description based on the "Match Rule" index.

    Write the updated T5_table to an Excel file:

python

T5_table.to_excel("Z:/Desktop/output2.xlsx", index=False)

This code writes the updated T5_table to an Excel file named "output2.xlsx".

    Aggregate the data and write to a second sheet in the Excel file:

makefile

aggregated = T5_table.groupby(['Company ID
